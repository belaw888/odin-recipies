# odin-recipes

This is the first formal project assigned in The Odin Project **Foundations** course. Skills I will demonstrate in this project include:

- Understanding of the technologies that enable the internet

- File manipulation and navigation with CLI

- Workflow best practices, including useful commit messages

- Git and Github (also with CLI)

- Basic HTML, including boilerplate and the most common tags

I am excited to finally reach this stage because the lessons have been a bit boring since I already have some experience with the content. However, I definitely feel like this has been worth it to fill gaps in my understanding and build a stronger foundation.
